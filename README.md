### 🚀 About
I enjoy turning messy, real-world problems into **scalable and maintainable systems**.  
Most of my work lives in backend & system design, but I’m comfortable going full-stack when needed.

I care a lot about:
- system design & trade-offs  
- performance and reliability  
- code that’s easy to reason about  
- building things people actually use

### 🛠 Tech I use
**Languages**: Java, Python, TypeScript, PHP 
**Backend**: Spring Boot, FastAPI
**Frontend**: React, Next.js, Angular
**Data**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Elastic Search, Redis
**Infra**: Docker, AWS, Azure
**AI**: LLM integrations for real products
